Every dbt project needs a `dbt_project.yml` file â€” this is how dbt knows a directory is a dbt project. It also contains important information that tells dbt how to operate on your project.

The following is a list of all available configurations in the `dbt_project.yml` file.

    <h4>YAML syntax</h4>
    dbt uses YAML in a few different places. If you're new to YAML, it would be worth doing a tutorial to learn how arrays, dictionaries and strings are represented in YAML.
